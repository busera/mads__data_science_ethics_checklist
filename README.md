# Data Ethics Checklist for Data Science Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a Data Ethics Checklist designed for data science projects, created as part of a university assignment in the MADS SIADS593 Ethics course. The assignment required designing a pledge, oath, or checklist relevant to a professional domain, incorporating course concepts and outside research.

Final document: [Data Ethics Checklist](https://github.com/busera/mads__data_science_ethics_checklist/blob/main/reports/Data%20Ethics%20Checklist%20v4.pdf)

## Project Details

- **Domain**: Data Ethics in Data Science Projects
- **Format**: Checklist
- **Course Concepts**: Transparency, Accountability, Fairness, Explainability
- **External Sources**: UK Government Data Ethics Framework, Principles for Accountable Algorithms and a Social Impact Statement for Algorithms, SIADS 501: Being a Data Scientist, and others


## Checklist Highlights

The Data Ethics Checklist is structured around the following project phases:

1. Project Organization
2. Problem Formulation Phase
3. Data Collection and Cleaning
4. Modeling and Analysis
5. Presentation and Deployment

Each phase includes specific questions addressing key ethical considerations.

## Key Features

- Incorporates principles of Transparency & Auditability, Accountability & Responsibility, Fairness, and Explainability & Accuracy
- Follows a four-stage phased approach based on the CRISP-DM reference model
- Limits to three key ethical questions per project phase for user-friendliness
- Addresses critical issues such as oversight, governance, bias mitigation, and explainability

## Reflection

This project applies ethics concepts to practical challenges in data science workflows. It emphasizes the importance of considering ethical implications throughout all stages of a data science project, from initial planning to final deployment.

## Future Work

While this checklist serves as a comprehensive starting point, it should be regularly reviewed and updated to address emerging ethical challenges in the rapidly evolving field of data science.
